								EXPENSE TRACKING APP IMPLEMENTATION 

POLYMORPHISM:-

Flexibility and Extensibility: Polymorphism allows you to define methods that can operate on objects of different types. 
For example, you can define a method that processes Transaction objects without needing to know whether they are Expense, Income, or any other subclass.

ENCAPSULATION:-

Encapsulating Data and Behavior: Classes like Expense, User, or Report would encapsulate related attributes and methods. For example, an Expense class might have 
private fields for amount, date, and description, and public methods like getAmount() or setAmount() to access or modify these fields.
Abstraction:

ABSTRACTION:-

Simplifying Complex Functionality: Abstraction allows you to define interfaces or abstract classes that provide a high-level view of the app's operations. 
For example, you could have an abstract Transaction class with methods like validate() and save(). Specific transaction types, such as Expense or Income, would 
implement these methods according to their unique requirements.

INHERITANCE:-

Reusing Common Code: Inheritance allows you to create a base class (like Transaction) that contains common fields and methods 
(like amount and date) shared by all transactions. Specific types of transactions, such as Expense or Income, can extend this base class to reuse the common code.

JAVA FX:-

By using JavaFX, you can create a visually appealing and user-friendly expense tracker app. The key is to break down the app into manageable components — 
views, controllers, and models — while applying OOP principles like encapsulation, 
inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. This modular approach makes the app more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.
To make the app interactive, you need to handle user actions such as button clicks, text input, and table selections. 
JavaFX provides an event-driven programming model where you can register event handlers for different components.

ACCESS MODIFIERS:-

Access modifiers and specifiers play a key role in building an expense tracking app by defining the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and
variables. This helps in encapsulating the data, securing sensitive information, and controlling how different parts of the application interact with each other.

By strategically using access modifiers, you can achieve:

Encapsulation: Protecting the internal state of objects and exposing only the necessary methods.
Security: Restricting access to sensitive methods and data, preventing unauthorized access or modifications.
Modularity: Allowing different parts of the app to work independently, reducing coupling between components.
Ease of Maintenance: Reducing the risk of unintended side effects when changes are made since access to variables and methods is controlled.

EXCEPTION HANDLING:-
In an expense tracking app, users might encounter unexpected scenarios, such as entering invalid data (e.g., a negative expense amount), encountering network issues when syncing data, or facing database connection failures. 
Exception handling allows the app to catch these errors and handle them appropriately without abruptly terminating.

Exception handling in an expense tracking app:

Manages errors gracefully to prevent crashes.
Improves user experience by providing meaningful feedback.
Ensures data integrity by managing transactions and preventing corrupt data.
Facilitates logging and debugging by capturing and recording error details.
Maintains application flow by allowing the app to recover from errors and continue running.
By effectively using exception handling, you create a more stable, user-friendly, and reliable expense tracking app.

MULTI-THREADING:-

Background Tasks: Multithreading allows resource-intensive operations (such as fetching data from a remote server, performing complex calculations, or generating reports) 
to run in the background while the main UI thread remains responsive. This ensures that the app's UI does not freeze or become unresponsive during lengthy operations.

Multithreading in an expense tracking app:

Improves UI responsiveness by running background tasks asynchronously.
Handles simultaneous operations efficiently, like data syncing or network communication.
Performs periodic tasks like backups or data updates without blocking the main thread.
Manages non-blocking I/O operations for database or file interactions.
Supports multiple user sessions concurrently in a multi-user environment.
Enhances performance by parallelizing data processing tasks.
Enables real-time notifications and alerts without affecting app responsiveness.

INTERFACES AND ABSTRACT CLASSES:-

In an expense tracking app, interfaces and abstract classes can help organize and structure the code in a flexible and reusable way.
By using interfaces, you can define contracts that different components must adhere to, promoting consistency and flexibility. Abstract classes, 
on the other hand, allow you to define shared behavior and state, which can be inherited and extended by more specific classes. This approach helps in organizing your code better, making it easier to maintain and extend.
